  <p id="mainp">Hello everyone,<br>Welcome to my biggest website project to date! I have created 3 to 4 websites, or perhaps even more, using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I started working on this website in 2022 during my vacation after 8th grade. Due to my commitments in 9th and 10th grade, I paused the development. After completing 10th grade, I revamped the website entirely.<br><br>If you like my work or wish to send me a message, please visit the home page. There are two options: you can either go to the 'Contact Me' page and fill out the form, or you can send me a message via WhatsApp.<br><br>Thank you for visiting my website!</p>

    <p class="aboutp aboutpw">This page features a green color theme. You can find the weather for any city, state, or country by using the search bar below. Additionally, there is an option to find the weather based on your phone's location.</p>

    <h1 class="abouth aboutht">About Time Page</h1>
    <p class="aboutp aboutpt">This page features a blue color theme. It displays the current time based on your phone's location. Although I initially wanted to include a search bar for finding the time in any place, similar to the weather page on this website, I was unable to implement it. Instead, I have listed all 294 time zones along with their corresponding continent and country names.</p>
